2.1 JavaScript: Basics Lab

PART 1

What are the data types of the following?
1.    var foo = “bar”; //string 
2.    var bar = 231; //number
3.    var boo = false; //boolean
4.    var aoo = “true”; //string 
5.    var oar = “5321.31”; //string
6.    var hoo; //undefined
7.    var tree = {family:“evergreen”, name:“pine”}; //object

PART 2

Which of the following is not valid?
A.    var x = 3, y = 4, z = “there”, a = “true”; 
B.    var w = “number:” + 7 
C.    var okay;
Okay = 5;
//c because its case sensitive  

PART 3

Create a function that takes in a number (called num) and string (called noun). Then returns the square of the number concatenated with the string. Ex: calling my_func(4, “hi”) returns 16 hi
//function squareNumber(num, noun) {
//   let squareNumber = num * num + " " + noun;
//   return squareNumber;
//}
//undefined
//squareNumber(7, "gladys");
//"49 gladys"

PART 4

Go through the function. What will text contain?
var mylist = [1, “David”, “Julia”, 21, “Gina”, 932, 53, 0, “Sean”]
var text = “”;
var x;
for (x in mylist) {
 if (x === “David”) { continue; }
 if (x === 53) {break;}
 text += x + “,”;
}
// the text will contain 1, Julia, 21, Gina, 932
